# Balloon Burst — Shooting Gallery

A simple "aim and click" reaction game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Goal: Pop 20 balloons within 30 seconds. Some balloons are bombs — clicking them reduces your score.

Files
- `index.html` — game page
- `styles.css` — styles and animations
- `game.js` — main game logic

2. Click "Start Game" or press Space.

Notes and tweaks
